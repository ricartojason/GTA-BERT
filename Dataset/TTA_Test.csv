248,"This app still sucks, but now it's because of battery life. 15% of my battery (300 mAh) that I use today comes from this app with 1 minute of screen time. And it's just dinner time, more battery will be drained before the day is over because of this terribly inefficient app.",0,0,0,1
249,"Try it again later. That's the message I get about half the time I use this app. I have the paid version. Right now my app is not working. I have to reinstall or go somewhere else to get my forecast. Reinstalling temporarily fixes it. What happened to this amazing app? I put my phone on airplane mode at night and often at other times. It will take a long time for applications to open properly again. It gives the same message, please try again later... The only reason I use it now is that I live in the mountains and it has a weather station that is more accurate. All other applications have a mountain down in a city. This app is a frustrating disappointment. I'm canceling my subscription but still using it plus Weather Bug when this shit won't open. Geez, fix that damn thing, you fucking losers!",0,0,0,1
