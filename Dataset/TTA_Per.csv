2,"Great security app, but I also run others on my phone just in case, like I do on my PC, but for what it has in terms of what it does, it's a great app to run on your phone and it doesn't slow down my i5 at all. everything I don't have an app on my phone that slows it down at all and I don't understand what people are complaining about It does what it says it's going to do and I would tell anyone to put it on their phone Help your phone",0,0,0,1
3,"I don't have any problems with the security protection or device locator. I would recommend this app to other people except for the one problem I have. This app drains the battery life of my devices pretty quickly. I went to bed last night around 12am with my phone fully charged, when I woke up this morning at 6 my battery was at 1. No other app had done that to my phone. I would give this app five stars if it didn't drain my battery life.",0,0,0,1

I don't need you to back up my photos or anything else on my phone. I need you to tell me the storage on my phone. None of this makes my phone more secure, which is what you're promoting. Everything mentioned below is already taking care of all I needed you to do was ensure or at least help ensure that there was further security analysis that would not provide for them to remove it.",0,0,0,1

7,"Able to get a good overall picture of my physical progress. However, timing is a problem. Syncing via bluetooth takes some time. I have a Charge 2 tracker. It seems that activity syncing is quite disabled and it seems to sync backwards. Instead of charging 2 for app updates, app updates charge 2 with stale activity data. For example, my Charge 2 tracker and my app were synced and showing 20 minutes of activity. After brisk walking, loading activity 2 was shown for 30 minutes. When I synced it to the app, charge 2 again showed only 20 minutes of activity",0,0,0,1

This app is doing nothing but taking up memory on my phone right now. The app crashes too frequently to be considered usable",0,0,0,1
15,"The filters themselves are great. The processing time is not too long. However, it takes too long to individually observe the results of multiple filters. The problem is exacerbated by adding additional filters. Previews would be awesome or maybe let the app process multiple photo filters while connected overnight.",0,0,0,1

The processing delay is not that bad considering the nature of the filters, but it could be better. Additionally, it is difficult to adjust the intensity of the effects; it's pretty messy to even try to get it to stop. Overall, 45 for features (you can't really customize an effect that I can see) and 35 for functionality. It's discouraging to use the app to its full potential if it keeps crashing. I prefer that developers improve already present features and their functionality before introducing something new.",0,0,0,1

Everything still works great except for the fact that sometimes I want to cry because of how much it lags and crashes. I use the app to create bases for small animations and it always crashes.

It has almost all the features of Photoshop and you can have unlimited layers, which makes it feel even more professional and worth your money. You can import your own images and even import more into the already opened file if you need a reference photo.

50,"Where this game really fails are the controls. If you're going to create an endless MARIO game, the controls MUST be flawless to compensate for the lack of freedom that regular Mario games offer. The touch control isn't responsive enough and having 3D Touch disabled doesn't help. The game is unnecessarily difficult to play since you don't have the precision of a gamepad.

Within a few hours of the app being on my phone, it dropped to 50. Since the app is so fun, it's a shame this was a problem, enough for me to remove it from my phone entirely.

Do I need to move on and look for another workout app or not? I updated because I don't like apps that slow down my phone. And as you know, there are many applications, this is my main one for now.

66,"After trying many of the other 7-minute workout apps, I've come to the conclusion that this is my favorite, please note personally. Most others require you to pay for other features when this app offers them after the initial purchase. The workout itself is amazing because I can keep my device off and the workout continues. The add-ons in this app are great too, but I think the initial training is enough. The reasons I gave this a 45 instead of a 55 is due to the lack of updates and improvements that could be made to the app to adapt to newer devices, such as the iPhone 6 or 7. Since it is outdated, the app consumes a little more battery on newer devices than older ones, your device will send you a notification of this problem when you use the app as a reminder. In the end, this is a very good app for those who, like me, don't have time to train for long periods of time in an expensive gym. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone.",0,0,0,1

The reason I gave this a 45 instead of 55 is due to the lack of updates and possible improvements to the app to accommodate newer devices like the iPhone 6 and 7. The app is older and will drain your battery slightly more on newer devices than on older devices. If you use the app as a reminder, your device will send you a notification regarding this issue.
