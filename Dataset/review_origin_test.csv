6,"I can see that if a song is downloaded, it will show it to the right, but it would be nice if we pressed add song to a particular playlist by mistake to a song that was already in that playlist, it would warm us.

7,"Finally, it would be nice if the song cover (that screen that pops up when a song is tapped) wouldn't automatically pop up.

13,Great job amazon! Keep up the good work! I rate 6 stars!,0,0,0,0
14,In my opinion the UI is rather user friendly and I can only think of a couple minor improvements which are necessary. For a low price you gain access to a wide array of music when subscribing to Unlimited. I would say about 80-85% of the songs I've searched have been available. The two components which I believe Amazon failed to deliver on is the music category selections and the stations which are expected to play music from similar artist or those which match your preferences.,0,0,0,0
15,Pandora is far beyond Amazon Music in their apps ability to recognize music preferences. If Amazon can improve these components I would likely use the app exclusively when listening to music.,1,0,0,0

17,"I have an Amazon Prime account so I got this app so I could listen to music. I created a playlist and just one day later, all the titles grayed out and would no longer play. You have to pay a ridiculous amount for the Unlimited Prime account so you can keep listening. It's total bull. My advice: you're better off with a Spotify account. Cheaper and will actually let you listen to songs. ",1,0,0,0

19,Issues with adding music sometimes to my playlist I would get messages to try again later. U don't get messages like that from Spotify... option here on music isn't as wide as other music apps tbh if ur going to pay 10 bucks a month I'd go with Spotify it's just easier to use.

21,"Having compared all free and paid online music services the edge goes to Amazon Prime Music. When combing Alexa, echo, and wireless internet speakers throughout my home, the flexibility and voice commands are truly what I was looking for. Key is the upgrades speaker over those of echo, connected directly to echo show or Internet wireless for a rich sound were ever you direct or all over the house. You can add upgrade speakers (think Sonos) as you go. Very nice",0,0,0,0
22,"This app should allow you to cast to your Echo(s). I decked out my house with Echos with no good way to control the music playing through them. I have to set up temporary playlists just to play what I find in the app. Verbally telling Alexa every single track I specifically want just doesn't do it for me.  Otherwise, the visual design and other functionality of this app is great - certainly on par with the Apple Music app. Please improve Echo integration.",1,1,0,0

32,"I got rid of my Spotify subscription to get this service, which I am thoroughly enjoying. I find it very intuitive and user friendly. My only complaint, and it's a pretty big one for me, is that the app resets itself way too quickly. I'll be listening to a song I really like, usually one I just discovered in a random playlist, then I'll get a 30 second phone call, and when I go back to listening it sets me back on the main page without giving me the option to continue listening to the song.

All I want is the definition to a word and it has me waiting for minutes for the ad to pass. It would much quicker, easier, and less frustrating to just look it up on Google (where there are no ads). As I said before, I use this app everyday, and it's ONLY PROBLEM is the ads! Dude seriously, I just want to know what the word pandemonium means and not about your pediatric care or anything else.

I had noticed right after making two purchases that I could buy the power pack for a few cents more. I emailed them several times with no reply. This is also the first app that charged me tax. Which that didn't bother me so much. I had to retire as a nurse after becoming ill, and this app helps me a lot. But after I see how they will not even respond to their customers I'm really second thinking this app. So I've spent about $13 on this app. You live and you learn. Anything made my this developer I would not purchase because they do not believe in customer service. What a shame. If it wasn't for my health issues causing me memory and comprehension problems I definitely would not patronize them. If they had just responded to let me know that was not possible to do I would've respected that. But I have gotten no responses at all. Not acceptable from a charging business!",0,0,1,0

In my opinion, in  the NY market you can't responsibly shop for a home without knowing the most accurate TAXES sometimes 3-3.25% of price and as I have already been denied a mortgage because taxes were $14,600 on a $519,000 home and I didn't know (the correct taxes).

If I pause a scene, minimize the app, return to the app (if it lets me), and attempt to resume playback, the app will display a heavily pixilzed image for upwards of 10 seconds.
