This all started when the Pokmon spawn time changed from 5 to 10. Not much, it was still fun and easy to progress. Then there was little grace of time before they relaxed their second fatal renewal. And they razed the tracks of their system. They SERIOUSLY TOOK THE ONLY WAY TO ACCURATELY FIND POKMON They also removed every third of the gunners, which was literally the only reason for all players to actually catch Pokmon. But more advanced developers like the FPM survived. Then they killed no hope by adding a captcha robot detector feature. All these advanced third-party scanners have been removed. Being able to figure out where I wanted to catch Pokmon was the only reason I played Pokmon. But I still played for a while by riding my bike and running some trails. But then it was the last straw when Pokmon stopped appearing if he walked, ran or biked too fast. Now, all I can do is go through the Pokmon at the speed of an old man to catch a piglet or two. Or if I'm lucky, rare and tricky rattata. That's as much as I care about this part. Pokemon has lost like 90 of its players because of Niantic's bad decisions. Also, seriously, the buddy system is complete and utter garbage. I would walk 5km to get 1 candy for my eevee and don't forget the Pokmon high end near tracking system. Which are completely broken.

If you want to make an endless runner Mario game, the controls MUST be flawless to compensate for the lack of freedom that regular Mario games offer.

411,"After trying many of the other 7 minute workout apps I have come to the conclusion that this one is my personal favorite, note the personal. Most others require you to pay for other features if that app provides them after the initial purchase. The workout itself is fantastic because I can leave my device turned off and the workout still continues. The add-ons in this app are great too, but I feel like the first workout is enough. The reason I rated this a 45 instead of a 55 is because there are no updates and there could be improvements to the app to adapt it to newer devices like the iPhone 6 or 7. Because it is outdated, the app is As newer devices use battery a little more than older devices, your device will send you a notification about this issue when you use the app as a reminder. Ultimately, this is a very good app for those who, like me, don't have time to work out in an expensive gym for a long time. I would definitely recommend this app to everyone.",0,0,0,1
