1279,"The filters offered within this application are really quite fun. When I choose to post a picture, I find myself applying all of the filters to see which one I like best. Since you have to select each filter individually and wait for the processing, this can be time consuming. There are some hidden features, in the sense that it's not obvious they are there. You can drag you finger left right on the image to change the intensity of the effect. You can swipe down to create a split screen and move it around but it's a little clumsy. Also, if you want to save the image and post it, those are individual steps instead of selecting multiple actions at once. There is one thing I am unhappy about. You can't change the location assigned to a posted image and they use your current location instead of the location the photo was taken. Since I tend to up load photos once I am home, the location information is always incorrect. I would like the ability to apply the filters on my computer. I'm going to try and print some of the images just to see what happens. I really like the idea of this application, but it's not a mature offering yet.     ",1,0,0,0

Overall, 45 for it's features you can't really customize an effect that I can see and 35 for functionality. It's discouraging to use the app with all it's potential if it keeps crashing.

2885,"Pokmon go, is an awesome game, but apparently Niantic isn't very concerned about how many people play their game because of the recent updates. All this began when the time for Pokmon to spawn was changed from 5 to 10. Not a big deal, it was still fun and promoted walking. Then, there was a small grace period before they released their second fatal  update. They scrapped their tracking system. SERIOUSLY THEY REMOVED THE ONLY WAY TO FIND POKMON ACCURATELY That also removed all third party scanners, which literally was the only reason most of the players actually went to catch Pokmon. But more advanced trackers like FPM survived. Then they killed any form of hope by adding a captcha robot detector feature. Which removed all the advanced third party scanners. Being able to actually know where the Pokmon I wanted to catch were was the only reason I played Pokmon go. But I still played for a while by riding my bike and running certain trails. But then, the final straw was when Pokmon ceased to appear if you walked, ran or biked too fast. Now, all I can do in Pokmon go is walk around at the speed of Old man to catch a pidgey or two. Or if I'm lucky, a rare and elusive rattata. That's how much I care at this point. Pokmon go lost like 90 of its players because of Niantic's wrong decisions. Also, seriously, the buddy system is is complete and total garbage. Let me walk 5km to get 1 candy for my eevee And don't forget about Pokmon go's high end nearby tracking system. Which is completely broken. There was a koffing on the last slot which means it was the farthest away and suddenly it appears right in front of me.

The other thing that needs to be changed is less about rural areas, but if more then one Pokmon get knocked out in the same day, only the first rewards coins.

Legendaries have been hyped up ever since the game came out, and not only am I sorely disappointed but I will never get one. Again, good raids are far and few between, so finding a legendary raid is hard enough. Then I can never beat one because there are no players that play near me to help with the raid. And say that for some reason I actually do complete a raid which I won't then the catch rate is THREE PERCENT To make it fairer, I think they should do two things. One of which is a suggestion and the other is something that absolutely needs to happen. I think a good idea would be that the legendary raid cp should not be a determined thing, and should be created by the amount of people who are in the actual raid. That way it would still be really hard, but not impossible for rural players to complete. The other thing that needs to be implemented is the increasing catch rate of legendaries to at least 15 considering beating them is hard enough. Maybe they could also have an event where all of the already released legendaries are put in raids and their cp cut in half if they don't do the auto scaling cp.     ",0,0,0,0

Procreate has exceptional art tools, but lacks any additional tools to support those art tools  and in my opinion, this is what causes Procreate to fall a bit short. The addition of the new draw assist tool in SBP was a total game changer  being able to ink panels on the fly and illustrate flawless ellipses, lines, squares, etc has made that app PERFECT for both rapid concepting and professional production level art.

Every time you win a rally it will appear you have been given the appropriate amount of Toads, but check again. I usually only get about half of the color Toad it says I got when I win a rally while I'm maxed out. This made it very difficult to get the 2500 green toads I needed.

4172,"After trying many of the other 7minute workout apps, I conclude that this one is my personal favorite, note the personal. Most of the other one require you to pay for other features when this app gives it after the initial purchase. The workout itself is amazing because I can keep my device turned off and the workout will still continue. The addons in this app are also great, but I feel like the initial workout is enough. The reasons why I gave this a 45 instead of a 55 is because of the lack of updates and the improvements there could be on the app to accommodate more recent devices, like the iPhone 6 or 7. Since it is out of date, the app drains a bit more battery on newer devices than it does on older ones your device will send you a notification of this issue when using the app as a reminder. In the end, this is a very good app for those who, like myself, do not have the time to workout for long periods of time in an expensive gym. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone.

4455,"I have to say that after using this app compared to the multitude of other weather notification apps that I have, I am not impressed at all. I live in Savannah, GA where we get some pretty bad weather from time to time and I like to know when that weather is on my back door. Just recently we had a mild tornado outbreak, as well as a slew of severe thunderstorms. Of all of the apps that I have for weather with the notifications turned on, NOAA was the very last app to give me a notification that the storm was happening, and at times that notification was almost an hour after the storm had passed. If this was the only app that I had giving me notifications, my family and myself could have wound up seriously injured or worse if just one of those tornado producing storms had hit my house and I was relying on this app. The sad thing is that this is a paid app, that I purchased for a little bit of reassurance during bad weather to give me some piece of mind and the only thing it has done is make me more weary about severe weather in my area. And for anyone that reads this and is wondering, this has not been the only time that the app has been extremely delayed in letting me know that there was bad weather approaching. It happened in April, as well as January, during the tornado outbreak across GA. So basically, it's not a fluke.     ",0,0,1,0

And I live in a rather large Midwestern state, so it's ridiculous that the city name scales larger and larger as you zoom out, covering the state.

I also noticed that the emoji screen offered doesn't have all the emojis as when using the iPhone keyboard. It would be nice to be able to talk to text also without changing keyboards.

I can hear my heartbeat just fine, but not baby's. All I get is static with baby. I can hear kicks though, which early on when kicks first started was kind of cool to hear. Also it's been a good tool to use if baby hasn't moved around a lot in the day  when I put my phone on my belly the pressure and the noise really makes baby move around. So perhaps that's the problem To be fair, I complained to the developer and they responded quickly, however they basically gave me the instructions on how to use the app quiet room, find your heartbeat first, try the different mode, etc which I had already been doing. I never pay for apps so this one was a disappointment... and I really was hoping it would work. Next baby I will buy a stethoscope.    ",0,0,0,0
5886,"After reading all of the positive reviews, I was excited about this app.  We thought it would be a more affordable option than buying a heart monitor in retail and we wanted to be able to checkin on the baby throughout the pregnancy because we had complications in the past.  Unfortunately, I never once could hear my little ones' heartbeat which was shocking considering we never had issues finding or holding onto a heartbeat in the doctors office. I tried the developer's suggestions to find a quiet room and I also tried to listen at multiple times throughout the day and it never worked.  Even at 39 weeks, I never heard a heartbeat regardless of where I positioned it.  In fact, I had a hard time even capturing my own heartbeat . I gave it two stars because it is easy to use good navigation and userfriendly and offers some good features but since I wasn't able to ever hear a heart beat it was a waste of money.  Since everyone's pregnancy is different, it could just be that I wasn't a good candidate for this type of thing...maybe it would work better for others    ",0,0,1,0

I would suggest waiting until around 25 weeks to make sure you can actually can pick up the heart beat, but dont be discouraged if you dont at that point. The app suggests you wait until youre between 30 and 40 weeks and I have had no difficulty finding his heart beat now that I am 30 weeks. Earlier it was a little bit difficult. Make sure you use airplane mode when youre looking for the heart beat though and that youre in a quiet room.    ",0,0,0,0

MISSING INFO or blank fields must be completed. In my opinion, in  the NY market you can't responsibly shop for a home without knowing the most accurate TAXES sometimes 3-3.25% of price and as I have already been denied a mortgage because taxes were $14,600 on a $519,000 home and I didn't know (the correct taxes).

If I pause a scene, minimize the app, return to the app (if it lets me), and attempt to resume playback, the app will display a heavily pixilzed image for upwards of 10 seconds.

I was hoping it was a glitch that would be addressed in an update, but apparently not. LG V30, Verizon",1,0,0,0
